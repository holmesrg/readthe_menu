# Read The Menu 
is a service to enable take away restaurants to store a HTML and PDF version of their menu so customers can scan a QR Code to read a menu prior to getting to a drive through window, or the front counter.

**Longer term** it is suggested that the service will allow placing orders, with contactless payment at the pickup point.

**Longer, longer term**, the service will enable working with Ola et al to arrange for delivery. This will require using the MapBox or other APIs to figure out the best route, therefore the distance and time to give an estimate of the delivery cost (which should be fixed so the driver can't mess it up)

## Development framework
Considering the use of React Native for this, perhaps using Amplify, Netlify etc. as long as it can fit into the free plan.
